Development Process
Throughout the development of my web portfolio, I followed a systematic approach to ensure that the final product was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Research & Inspiration: 
Before diving into the code, I spent time researching various portfolio designs and gathering inspiration.

Wireframing: 
I sketched out a basic layout of the portfolio, deciding on the placement of elements and the flow of information.
Development: With a clear vision in mind, I began the coding process, starting with the basic structure and then layering on styles and interactivity.
