Development Process
Throughout the development of my web portfolio, I followed a systematic approach to ensure that the final product was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Research & Inspiration: Before diving into the code, I spent time researching various portfolio designs and gathering inspiration.
Wireframing: I sketched out a basic layout of the portfolio, deciding on the placement of elements and the flow of information.
Development: With a clear vision in mind, I began the coding process, starting with the basic structure and then layering on styles and interactivity.
Challenges & Learnings
Every project comes with its set of challenges, and this portfolio was no exception. Here are some of the challenges I faced and how I overcame them:

Responsive Design: Ensuring the portfolio looked great on all devices was a challenge. I used media queries and flexible grid layouts to achieve a responsive design.

Performance Optimization: As I added more content and media, the site's load time increased. I learned about and implemented various optimization techniques such as lazy loading and image compression to enhance the site's performance.

Browser Compatibility: Making sure the portfolio worked seamlessly across different browsers was another hurdle. I used tools like Can I use and BrowserStack to test and fix compatibility issues.

Through these challenges, I learned the importance of thorough testing, continuous learning, and seeking feedback. This project taught me not just about coding but also about the nuances of web design and user experience.
