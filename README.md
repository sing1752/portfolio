# Portfolio

## Development Process

Throughout the development of my web portfolio, I followed a systematic approach to ensure that the final product was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

### Research & Inspiration

Before diving into the code, I spent time researching various portfolio designs and gathering inspiration.

### Wireframing

I sketched out a basic layout of the portfolio, deciding on the placement of elements and the flow of information.

### Development

With a clear vision in mind, I began the coding process, starting with the basic structure and then layering on styles and interactivity.

## Challenges & Learnings

As an international student and a full-time student, it was a difficult road till the end of the semester but I was disciplined enough to take on this challenge.I took some leaves from work and dedicated my time towards the assignments and pretty happy about the result.I plan dedicating more time in the vacation also to get a edge in the third semester.
